Does your program run without error?: yes

Additional comments (including problems and extra credit): -I arbitrarily initialize my Solutions array list to size 20, this should be the size of the longest string in the input string files, I was getting an array index out of bounds exception and this solved it, perhaps not in the most graceful way. 
-I did some amount of extra credit, adding a timer and running the program 5 times in a row printing out the results for each run. I then took the average of these results and compared to see how each implementation performed.
