Additional comments (including problems and extra credit): 
- distinct paths works, however on the resulting paths after the first path, the first node is repeated, for instance if the answers were 1->2->3 and 1->4->3, it would show as 1->2->3 and 1->1->4->3
- dijkstra shortest path doesn't work for most cases, for testing purposes it should be fine to check functionality on graph1.txt the path from vertex 0 -5, that works with removing vertices and changing and adding edge weights, but i can't figure out whats going on with other edges.
