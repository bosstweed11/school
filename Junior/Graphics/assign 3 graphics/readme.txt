Known bugs (if any):
-sphere does not have caps
-no transformations for cube or house

Extra credit (describe what you did, if any):
- i don't know if these are extra credit but i carried over the normals and tessalations from homework 2

Comments:  
-all functionality of the program is there as far as i know. the main problems are the caps on the sphere and that i did not include the cube or house in the rotations however the shapes that are drawn(sphere,torus,cone,and cylinder) work for all possibilities presented in the assignment sheet.
