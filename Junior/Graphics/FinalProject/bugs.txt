		OpenAL is a huge pain in the ass, uses deprecated methods, and sucks.
Potential Solutions?
		Switch to a different kind of audio player (perhaps limiting our ability to be cross-platform compatible if we pick some native OSX method).
		Find a decent tutorial (I emailed the two 1566ers who did the presentation).
Importance?
		Not urgent, but sound is completely crucial to the project.


FIXED:

		first bug, I'm so pround :|

		create_nozzles() calls make_cylinder()

		The bug is related to using pointers to point to other pointers 
		(NOZZLE has a SHAPE pointer(to point to the cylinder that will be created))
		I cannot set v_start field of SHAPE to start my rotations in creating the cylinder, without getting a seg fault. I think i have to malloc v_start, but I've never had to malloc for struct arrays in previous projects so I don't know what is wrong.
Fixed 11/17 - Zach
		I just kinda replaced the stuff with code I'd used from hw5 (and stolen from texture_demo before that).
