Theme: Different types

   * Willow

      * Circular array for the trails, a la snake.

         * You can go through the array and increase/decrease brightness to have the outermost particles be the most well lit
         * Small cube size, high quantity (lol)

   * Sparkler out of the nozzle


      * Kinda like trails on the weeping willows, just pick an angle and shoot out crazy colored vectors


Screamer
New field in particle - is_screamer
in time_out
  if is_screamer
     per particle
       adjust trans_x, trans_y via cylinder


nozzle sparkles
large trail_size
adjust the ray to make it thinner/thicker
no trans_y
do adjust start_x per particle to give it angle


Sound:
Like the other variables, have a range of sounds to choose from, then RNG.
RNG to adjust volume
