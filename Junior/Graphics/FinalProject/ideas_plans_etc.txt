11/17 - Zach

We always have facebook/texting and all sorts of ways to communicate, but this could be could for keeping a simple log of what we talk about (ie I'll do this then, you should work on this now, etc).

My plan for today is to work on OpenAL, and try to play the 1812 overture when the user clicks the screen, turning it off when they click again.
