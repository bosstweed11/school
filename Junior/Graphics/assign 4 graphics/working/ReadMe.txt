Comments:  
- i don't know that i completely understand using my own matrices for gluperspective, so i did not
- I'm not sure that i show all of the debug info in print

- most of this project was unfamiliar to me, i feel like most of the requirements were done for it, but i also feel like i should have done things better? I'm not sure. I think my program does all or most of the required tasks but my understanding of the tasks were a little fuzzy, so i can't explicitly say what other bugs are present but I'm sure there are more.
