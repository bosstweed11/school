<title>Eighth JavaScript Example (MUSIC POLL)</title>
<!-- 
     This html file sets up a page for a simple music poll.  A nice exercise
     would be for you to write a PHP script that will process this form
     and keep track of the results.
     -->

// This handout is using (mostly) DOM 0, which is not an official DOM standard
// but is still widely used.  See other handouts for demonstrations of some
// DOM 1 and DOM 2 access.

// This function does the following:
// 1) Returns false if "other" is checked and no answer is provided
// 2) Returns false if "other" is checked and the answer matches
//    one of the other choices
// 3) Tells the user if a write-in choice is entered but "other" was
//    not selected (but still sends the form)
