Assignment 3 CS 0401

Create a command line hangman game that allows for free letters

Exercises handling states even more, handles parsing text inputs, handling wins and losses and writing to files. No GUI.

Note: Assign3.class is the original class file, I found Assign3.java in the Assignment 4 folder (GUI version) and its a little different but not much.
